# Notes About This Folder
In this folder, there are both binary executables as well as the plain text source code.
Files that end with a `-extension` are the compiled executables
and should be able to be run without any need to install the required libraries.
Others, like the .py, .js, and .sh files, need to have the appropriate libraries installed
(NodeJS for .js, Python3 for .py, Bash for .sh).
