# Notes About This Folder
In this folder, there are both binary executables as well as the plain text source code.
## Executables
Files that end with a `-*` extension are the compiled executables
and should be able to be run without any need to install the required libraries.
## Non-executables
Others, like the .py, .js, and .sh files, need to have the appropriate libraries installed
(NodeJS for .js, Python3 for .py, Bash for .sh).
These files can be run like so `node test.js`, `python3 test.py `, and `./test.sh`.
## Source Code
For all of the examples (both compiled and interpreted), the source code is available. Just open the file with the correct extension.
