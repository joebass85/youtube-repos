Fibonacci test #1 with no optimization - 1955.354 seconds (did not finish. Stopped at this time.)
Fibonacci teset #2 with memoization - 22.695 seconds
Fibonacci test #3 with memoization and multithreading - 14.726 seconds
Fibonacci test #4 with memoization and multiprocessing - 36.241 seconds

Timed using the built-in shell program time.
All code is Python 3.
The Multithreading and Multiprocessing code is basically the same, with one small change in line 22.
For Multithreading, it should read "with concurrent.futures.ThreadingPoolExecutor()".
For Multiprocessing, it should read "with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor()".
